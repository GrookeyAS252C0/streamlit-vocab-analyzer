      "From the 1990s to the early twenty-first century, the digital medium has undergone technological developments of unprecedented speed, moving from the ‘digital revolution’ into the social media era. Artists have always been among the first to reflect on the culture and technology of their time, and decades before the digital revolution had been officially proclaimed, they were experimenting with the digital medium.\n\nThe term ‘digital art’ has itself become an umbrella for such a broad range of artistic works and practices that it does not describe one unified set of aesthetics. One of the basic but crucial distinctions made here is that between art that uses digital technologies as a tool for the creation of more traditional art objects — such as a photograph, print, or sculpture — and digital-born, computable art that is created, stored, and distributed via digital technologies and employs their features as its very own medium. The latter is commonly understood as ‘new media art’. These two broad categories of digital art can be distinctly different in their manifestations and aesthetics and are meant as a preliminary diagram of a territory that is by its nature extremely hybrid.\n\nThe employment of digital technologies as an artistic medium implies that the work exclusively uses the digital platform from production to presentation, and that it exhibits and explores that platform’s inherent possibilities. The digital medium’s distinguishing features certainly constitute a distinct form of aesthetics: it is customizable, dynamic, interactive, and participatory, to name just a few of its key characteristics. However, the art itself has multiple manifestations and is extremely hybrid. It can present itself as anything ranging from an interactive installation with or without network components, virtual reality, software written by the artist, purely Internet-based art, or any combination thereof.\n\nTechnologies often tend to develop faster than the rhetoric evaluating them, and we constantly have to develop vocabulary for art using digital technologies as a medium — in social, economic, and aesthetic respects. The characteristics commonly associated with the digital medium need some further clarification since they are often used in such a general way that they hardly carry any meaning. The term ‘interactive’, for instance, has become almost meaningless due to its inflationary use for numerous levels of exchange. Ultimately, any experience of an artwork is interactive, relying on a complex interplay between contexts and productions of meaning at the recipient’s end. Yet, this interaction remains a mental event in the viewer’s mind when it comes to experiencing traditional art forms: the physicality of the painting or sculpture does not change in front of his or her eyes. With regard to digital art, however, interactivity allows different forms of navigating, assembling, or contributing to an artwork that go beyond this purely mental event. While the user’s or participant’s involvement with a work has been explored in performance art, happenings, and video art, we are now confronted with complex possibilities of remote and immediate intervention that are inherent to the digital medium.\n\nThe possibilities of complex interaction in digital art go far beyond the simple ‘pointing and clicking’ that offers nothing more than a sophisticated form of looking at a work, or the type of interactivity where a user’s act triggers a response. Far more fundamental changes take place with virtual art objects that are open-ended ‘information narratives’ with a fluctuating structure, logic, and closure, where control over content, context, and time is determined by the respective recipient through interaction. These types of works can take shape with varying degrees of control over their visual appearance by the artist or the audience. Digital art is not always collaborative in the original sense of the word but often relies on multi-user input. In some artworks, viewers interact within the parameters that have been set by the artist; in others, they set the parameters themselves, or become remote participants in time-based, live performances. In some cases, the visual manifestation of an artwork is ultimately created by the viewer: in such instances, a work of art may literally consist of a blank screen.\n\nThe digital medium is also dynamic and can respond to a changing data flow and the real-time transmission of data. A variety of artworks, some of which will be discussed later, have used ‘live’ stock market and financial data as a source for different kinds of visualizations. It is important to point out that the digital medium is not by nature visual but always consists of a ‘back end’ of code or scripting languages that mostly remain hidden and a visible ‘front end’ that is experienced by the viewer/user. The results can range from complex visuals to very abstract communication processes. Some digital art is predominantly visual; other works are more focused on raw data or databases. Another prominent feature of the medium is that it is customizable, adaptable to a single user’s needs or intervention, for example in artworks where the user’s individual profile becomes the basis for the development of and changes in the work.",
      "It is desirable that technologies develop swiftly in order to bring forth new ideas or new ways of thinking constantly. Technologies develop so fast that sometimes people do not appreciate the importance of the development. The development of artistic skills tends to be made subsequently to that of digital technologies. When we have rapid development of technologies, we are not equipped with language for the assessment of the new technologies.\n\nA viewer understands or interprets the meaning of a traditional artwork, but this does not involve any kind of change or transformation of the work itself. Many recipients of a traditional artwork often believe that they can change the interpretation of the work, but it is simply a mistake. Such traditional artworks as the painting and sculpture make an impression on the mind of the viewer when the viewer is broad-minded. When someone experiences a traditional artwork, it is the mentality of the viewer and the beauty of the work itself that change.\n\nAlthough experiencing digital artworks involves the interactivity between the work and the viewer to some extent, that interaction remains a mental event in the viewer’s mind. In producing the meaning of a digital artwork, the viewer often brings about changes to the work by handling it or giving some contribution to it. The interactivity between a digital artwork and its viewer is meaningless because it is remote and immediate. When a viewer is confronted with a digital artwork, the viewer participates in the work without producing any additional meaning to it."
